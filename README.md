# InTAS
InTAS is the realistic Ingolstadt traffic scenario for SUMO. This scenario comprises the following features:

- 24 hours of simulation
- Actual road network based on the city of Ingolstadt
- Street categories for VANETs simulation: *tunnel*, *under.building*, *under.bridge*
- Simulation of public parking areas 
- Real location of all Traffic Lights in city
- Simulation of real Traffic Light Systems
- Buildings shape and location 
- Simulation of public transport system: *real bus routes with the actual time-table*
- **Modeled and Validated with real traffic numbers**

You can watch [InTAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgPeBxXzDHc) presentation for the SUMO User Conference 2020. 

## Actual State
- **Validation:** 24 points of traffic measurment
- **Simulation of Traffic Light System (TLS):** 20 TLS
- **Actual Scenario Error (NRMSE):** 0.33
